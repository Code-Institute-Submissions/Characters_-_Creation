                        <p>Behind every clocktower lies a humble inventor, who slaved for hours, cutting each gear into shape by hand. Tinkerers and creators lie behind every city, and their best work will define a nation for centuries.</p>
                        <p>Artificers are something else. They infuse magic into their creations. Some become warriors, crafting their own firearms that shoot enchanted bullets. Others create flying companions that can conjure waves of fire onto enemies.</p>
                        <p>Artificers can rival all other spellcasters, their intelligence and quick-thinking allowing them to find out of the box solutions to problems that others may find impossible. Unlike other magic classes, artificer’s use gadgets to cast their spells. For example, when casting fireball, you may be launching a fiery grenade from a launcher on your forearm. When casting a spell to help you understand a language, you might be placing a device in your ear that will translate all languages you hear.</p>
                        <p>Due to this, artificers usually have the most creative ways of casting spells, and when you play one, you should think about how you might describe how your spells are casted. Here are some examples for you:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Cure wounds: Applying a salve to a wound on the body</li>
                            <li>Darkvision: Placing a pair of goggles over your eyes that allow you to see in the dark</li>
                            <li>Fly: A pair of wings that burst from a backpack you’re carrying, or a pair of boots that rocket you into the air</li>
                            <li>Water breathing: A tank of infinite air, attached to a mask you place over your face</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Artificers rely on intelligence to cast their ‘spells’, relying on a deep understanding of how their inventions work in order to perform feats that most would consider impossible. They also use dexterity to craft their complex creations. For this reason, races such as humans, gnomes and vedalken.</p>
                        <p>This being said, artificers aren’t just inventors, rather they use their inventions to bolster their other abilities. They might be fighters, archivists or alchemists. For this reason, you can play a variety of races when being an artificer, and aren’t just restricted to those with a naturally high intelligence.</p>

                        <p>Barbarians are one of the most powerful classes in D&D, in terms of raw strength and damage, and they’re feared by anyone who truly knows their might. The common idea of the barbarian is that they’re a dumb brute, destroying everything they see. While that may be true for some, barbarians vary greatly, and the smarter, wiser ones tend to be tribal chieftains, or soldiers on the frontlines of battle.</p>
                        <p>As a barbarian, you won’t have to wear armour. Instead you can grit your teeth and absorb the attacks of your enemies. You also gain the ability to rage, increasing your strength for a short period of time as your vision turns red and the force of your strikes becomes enough to shake a castle. At later levels, your strength increases further, you gain the ability to just say “no” if you are killed (provided you roll a constitution saving throw), and when you score a critical hit, you get to add extra dice to your damage.</p>
                        <p>There are a range of barbarians, from the simple berserker, who gain extra attacks from their frenzies, to more spiritual paths, such as the totem warrior, who worships an animal and gains features from them (such as the damage-resistance of a bear, the wings of an eagle, the speed of an elk) or the ancestral guardian, who can call forth their ancestors to aid them in a battle.</p>
                        <p>Barbarians rely primarily on strength and constitution; if you take a more spiritual path then wisdom will come in handy as well. Races such as human, bugbear (a giant kind of goblin), orc, half-orc, dwarf, goliath (reclusive giant-kin from the mountains), minotaur (yes you can play a minotaur in D&D) or tortle (a humanoid turtle) all work well as barbarians.</p>
