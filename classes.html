                        <p>Behind every clocktower lies a humble inventor, who slaved for hours, cutting each gear into shape by hand. Tinkerers and creators lie behind every city, and their best work will define a nation for centuries.</p>
                        <p>Artificers are something else. They infuse magic into their creations. Some become warriors, crafting their own firearms that shoot enchanted bullets. Others create flying companions that can conjure waves of fire onto enemies.</p>
                        <p>Artificers can rival all other spellcasters, their intelligence and quick-thinking allowing them to find out of the box solutions to problems that others may find impossible. Unlike other magic classes, artificer’s use gadgets to cast their spells. For example, when casting fireball, you may be launching a fiery grenade from a launcher on your forearm. When casting a spell to help you understand a language, you might be placing a device in your ear that will translate all languages you hear.</p>
                        <p>Due to this, artificers usually have the most creative ways of casting spells, and when you play one, you should think about how you might describe how your spells are casted. Here are some examples for you:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Cure wounds: Applying a salve to a wound on the body</li>
                            <li>Darkvision: Placing a pair of goggles over your eyes that allow you to see in the dark</li>
                            <li>Fly: A pair of wings that burst from a backpack you’re carrying, or a pair of boots that rocket you into the air</li>
                            <li>Water breathing: A tank of infinite air, attached to a mask you place over your face</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Artificers rely on intelligence to cast their ‘spells’, relying on a deep understanding of how their inventions work in order to perform feats that most would consider impossible. They also use dexterity to craft their complex creations. For this reason, races such as humans, gnomes and vedalken.</p>
                        <p>This being said, artificers aren’t just inventors, rather they use their inventions to bolster their other abilities. They might be fighters, archivists or alchemists. For this reason, you can play a variety of races when being an artificer, and aren’t just restricted to those with a naturally high intelligence.</p>

                        <p>Barbarians are one of the most powerful classes in D&D, in terms of raw strength and damage, and they’re feared by anyone who truly knows their might. The common idea of the barbarian is that they’re a dumb brute, destroying everything they see. While that may be true for some, barbarians vary greatly, and the smarter, wiser ones tend to be tribal chieftains, or soldiers on the frontlines of battle.</p>
                        <p>As a barbarian, you won’t have to wear armour. Instead you can grit your teeth and absorb the attacks of your enemies. You also gain the ability to rage, increasing your strength for a short period of time as your vision turns red and the force of your strikes becomes enough to shake a castle. At later levels, your strength increases further, you gain the ability to just say “no” if you are killed (provided you roll a constitution saving throw), and when you score a critical hit, you get to add extra dice to your damage.</p>
                        <p>There are a range of barbarians, from the simple berserker, who gain extra attacks from their frenzies, to more spiritual paths, such as the totem warrior, who worships an animal and gains features from them (such as the damage-resistance of a bear, the wings of an eagle, the speed of an elk) or the ancestral guardian, who can call forth their ancestors to aid them in a battle.</p>
                        <p>Barbarians rely primarily on strength and constitution; if you take a more spiritual path then wisdom will come in handy as well. Races such as human, bugbear (a giant kind of goblin), orc, half-orc, dwarf, goliath (reclusive giant-kin from the mountains), minotaur (yes you can play a minotaur in D&D) or tortle (a humanoid turtle) all work well as barbarians.</p>

                        <p>A common guard may have to fight, as may a bandit or a mercenary, but they are not true fighters. Fighters exist amongst criminals, knights and adventuring guilds, and show a natural drive towards combat, besting their enemies with ease. Fighters, although strong and quick, excel in all areas, such as tactics, negotiation, infiltration and leadership. A skilled fighter will rise quickly through the ranks of the toughest, most prestigious army.</p>
                        <p>As a fighter, you gain multiple attacks, up to 4 per round at 20th level, allowing you to decimate your enemies before they’ve even drawn their weapons. You can also give yourself a surge of adrenaline, allowing you to attack even more for 1 round. Finally, you get more improvements to your ability scores than any other class does.</p>
                        <p>There are a variety of paths you can go down as a fighter, from the champion, who scores up to 3 times as many critical hits as any other class, to the cavalier, who fights atop their mount, to the eldritch knight, who imbues their attacks with magic, decapitating their enemy just before shooting an explosive fireball at the archers 60 feet away.</p>
                        <p>A fighter’s best abilities are their constitution and strength; however you may choose to be an archer or gunslinger, in which case dexterity is going to be more important. Races best suited to be a fighter include; human, centaur, dragonborn, goliath, minotaur and warforged (robotic humans built from ancient times). That being said, fighter is such a varied class that it can be played by any race you wish.</p>

                        <p>Understanding and controlling the natural energy, the ki that flows through us all, the monk can perform nigh-impossible feats with ease. A monk can take on four armed opponents with only their fists, they can live to 70 and still best a fully armoured foe, they can go up against a giant and still strike so hard that their foe is knocked onto their back.</p>
                        <p>Monks take the path of discipline, of training every day, and learning how to gain mastery over ki, the force that flows through everything. Monks may have spent their lives in a secluded monastery, or might’ve been taught by a master and given relative freedom. They may have left their monastery for a variety of reasons; they might’ve been cast out or sent on an important mission.</p>
                        <p>Monks can catch arrows in midair and throw them back at enemies (that’s an actual ability by the way). They can dash, reaching speeds upwards of 120 feet in one round, that’s 20 feet a second! While some use weapons, you also have the option of using your fists, which will eventually be tough enough to do the same damage as a warhammer!</p>
                        <p>There are several paths a monk goes down. The way of the drunken fist relies on feinting your enemies, appearing much weaker than you are. The way of the four elements or the sun soul are more magical, and allow you to cast spells. There is also the way of the kensei, where you master a weapon, and use that, as a fighter might, against your enemies.</p>
                        <p>Monks’ power comes from their dexterity and wisdom, and as such, races such as humans, aarakocra (humanoid birds who can fly), elves, halflings, kenku (half birds whose flight and voice was taken from them) and tabaxi (humanoid felines) will all make a good monk. That being said, you may choose to create a strength based monk if you desire.</p>
